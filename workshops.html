     students, as well as longer projects detailed below:</p>

     <h2>Changing Tides</h2>
     <h3>Fighting Words and World Vision</h3>
     <p>Jim lead workshops with a group of young playwrights aged 14-17 over the
       course of several months to collaboratively create and write a play on the
       theme of ending violence against children, culminating in a staged reading
       at the Gate Theatre to an audience of over 200.</p>

     <h2>Social Justice and Drama in Education</h2>
     <h3> Fighting Words and DCU St. Patrick's College</h3>
     <p>Jim assisted drama workshops as part of B. Ed students' module on
       Drama in Education. Over the course of the semester, they devised a short
       play performed for local primary school students, with a follow-up Q&A.</p>

     <h2>Playwriting Summer Camps 2020</h2>
     <h3>Fighting Words</h3>
     <p>Jim designed and created a video playwriting workshop for groups
       aged 11-13 and 14-17 to be a part of the 2020 Playwriting Summer Camps,
       being conducted remotely due to the coronavirus pandemic.
       Later this month, he will be part of the team providing daily writing
       feedback for participants in the camps.</p>

       Moyle Park College (<em>To the Future and Back Again</em>)
       and Beneavin De la Salle College (<em>Dissent into Madness</em>).</p>
  
  <p> Hi guys, my name is Jim, I’m gonna talk a little bit about dialogue. Dialogue, along with character, setting, and story, is one of the building blocks of a play. 

You can have plays with no dialogue at all. Some of Samuel Beckett’s plays have characters who don’t say anything at all. The script is entirely stage directions. When you read the script for one of these, it looks more like details for a scientific experiment, or a maths equation.

And you can have monologue plays, also called monodramas, in which one or more characters tell the story entirely through monologues, without interacting with eachother.

You can have sections in your play where one character might have a monologue. And what that means is they’re speaking uninterrupted for a certain length of time. They’re expressing a certain idea, by themselves, solo. 

Monologue in a play are most successful where there is a context for them. Perhaps the character is giving a speech, delivering a eulogy, being interviewed, or perhaps they have just bottled up all the things they need to say and now it’s all coming out. There needs to be a convincing reason for why this character is expounding at length upon an idea, memory, or situation. Because that’s not really how we speak everyday. It’s very rare in a conversation for one person to talk for five minutes, to which the other person replies with another five minute block. What is more likely, is that one person will say something, to which the other 
person will respond, and back-and-forth. It’s not always an equal division, it’s very rarely 50 50. More often, one person talks more and the other person talk less. Louise may have spoken to you about status. A character’s status is their level of power/control. You might think that the person talking more has control of the scene, and has higher status, while the person talking less has lower status. That can be the case. Something interesting to explore is flipping the expectation. If someone is very nervous, or afraid, or they’re caught up in a lie they may talk much more. Likewise, if someone is very confident and secure in their status, they may only feel the need to talk when they wish to. So just as you could imagine a scene in which the person speaking more has higher status, you could also imagine a scene in which someone only providing very short interjections has the power.

So there are lots of different things to consider with the dialogue in your play.

Talking about the weather

So a key idea, to writing dialogue, is that there is no such thing as small talk on stage. Small talk is a good way of filling time, of breaking the ice with someone you’ve just met. However, on stage there is no room for unmotivated dialogue.  While it can be very entertaining to have characters saying very witty and well-crafted lines, unless it doesn’t have a relation to the story then it can be considered for cutting.

When people are talking about something that seems to be pointless, if it’s on stage it really isn’t pointless. If there are two characters making small talk, the question you should ask is what are they avoiding talking about. Perhaps one character is getting ready to ask the other one out on a date, so the way they are making small talk is very nervous and drawing things out while they are building themselves up to ask the big question, or you could have a situation where one character is really annoyed at the other for drinking the last of the milk and leaving the carton in the fridge, so the way they’re making small talk is very passive aggressive.

So I’m going to give you an exercise. In a few moments, I want you to pause the video and write a scene for five minutes. 

There are two characters.
They’re talking about the weather.
One character has something they want to tell the other.
The other character doesn’t want to know, they don’t want to hear it.

So that’s the blueprint for the scene, you can take it in any direction from there.
Stick to five minutes, it doesn’t have to be perfect but do try to reach an ending of some sort.
 So, let’s stick five minutes on the timer, pause the video, and come back to us when you’re finished.

Exercise: Talk about the weather. Format with character names on left, dialogue on the right. For reasons that will become clear later on. If you give your characters names you can just use the first initial of their name, to save space.

Welcome back! So you’ve just written a scene. Congratulations.

I think what we’re really getting at with this exercise is subtext. So subtext, if you break the word down into its constituent parts, SUB and TEXT, and do some detective work you can work out the meaning. Sub meaning below. Subterranean, below ground level. Subcutaneous, beneath the skin. And text, meaning the words we write. So subtext is what is running underneath the scene. It’s the dynamic between the two characters, one wanting to say something that the other doesn’t want to thear, which is going on all the time while they’re making chit chat about the weather.

Subtext is something that is really crucial to writing dramatically, writing for the stage. It gives a play energy, forward momentum, and tension. And over the course of a scene, or a full play, you want to manage that tension between the text and the subtext. If it’s always simmering beneath the surface, like a pot of boiling water, when there are moments that it boils up and erupts, those are the really exciting moments in a play. These moments are so exciting because we’ve kept the tension bubbling away in the lead up to the explosion.

I think a great source of drama is contrast between text and subtext. So in a scene, like the weather scene, where the text is quite mundane, if the subtext is very high stakes, life or death stuff, that elevates the small talk to an epic scale. Likewise, if the text is very dramatic and there is a subtle, personal subtext, it gives the scene a tragic, human quality.

Ordinary Dialogue

So! Getting back to dialogue. Think about how people speak everyday. Do they speak in perfectly formed sentences? Do they express exactly what they mean to say? Do they speak clearly? Do they hesitate? What’s really useful to do is to listen to the people around you. And pay attention to how people are talking as much as what they are saying. You may find that people speak in ways that are quite different from what we hear on stage, in film and on tv. 

Here are some things to look out for. I’ll say them first as a list, then I’ll go back through and say a bit about each of them.

False-starts
Self-correction
Interruption
Incorrect grammar
Non-sequiturs

False starts: If someone begins a sentence several times, or trails off and tries again.
“So back then… I was training at the time… I was an apprentice to a locksmith.”

Self-corrections: When someone is saying something and correcting details as they go along. There’s some potential for comedy here if their corrections are completely irrelevant to the story.
“My rendezvous with the informant took place last Wednesday, or was it Tuesday, no it can’t have been Tuesday because I was having my hair done…”

Interruption: Fairly self-explanatory. I think it can be interesting to explore the dynamic of interruption. It can be antagonistic, which we are most familiar with. If someone is speaking, and someone else completely cuts them off. There can also be almost collaborative interruption. The  image I always have is an old couple who have been together for years telling a story together, taking turns and interweaving the story. So interruptions. can show characters in conflict, or in sync with eachother.

Incorrect grammar: In day to day life, it’s very rare for people to speak in perfectly correctly formed sentences. Even the idea of what is correct should be up for debate. Language is a vehicle for communication, and non-standard grammar often can communicate more meaning, or be more stylistically interesting than textbook grammar. Listen out for how people speak and form sentences, and you will have an ear for it when you are 
Writing dialogue for characters.

Non-sequiturs: When someone says something completely unrelated to the previous part of the conversation. This could be a memory prompted by something the other person has said, something that has been on their mind that they want to bring up, or a realisation, a penny that has just dropped.

Character based dialogue
You can communicate information on your character through the way that they speak. Are they optimistic or pessimistic? Are they very motivated? Are they inventive? Are they lazy? Are they lethargic? Some things to consider include:

Choice of words
Sentence length
Rhythm of speech.

As an example, if you were writing a scene with two characters, an optimist and a pessimist. The optimist could use positive words, while the pessimist uses negative ones. Their sentence lengths and speech rhythm contrast with each other.
O: My friend! How are you doing on this beautiful— really , on this magnificent morning?
P: Not bad.

Background
You can also communicate information on your characters’ backgrounds and identities through their dialogue. Different groups and communities each have specific vocabularies. For example I googled Irish slang and got a list of 100 words. Now if I was from somewhere outside of Ireland, and had never visited, and I wanted to write a character from Ireland I could read that article and use those slang words in my script. But the chances of it sounding authentic are fairly slim. Often the subtle difference between an authentic line of dialogue and an inauthentic one, is in the natural rhythms of speech. These can only be learnt by listening. If you are writing a scene with characters drawn from the world around you, you have a great resource, as you are the authority! You will have a natural ear for when something sounds right.

To go back to our pessimist from before. Using a negative to express a positive - “Not bad” actually meaning “I’m alright, yeah” - is particularly Irish. Think about how someone from America might express the same idea: “Awesome!” See also the Irish use of the word “Grand”, depending on the context it can mean everything from “Excellent” to “Really quite dreadful please don’t ask me to elaborate.” These are local quirks of dialogue to listen out for. 

Right. I reckon it’s time for another quick exercise. Take the scene that you just wrote, the weather scene let’s call it, and cover up the left hand side where the characters' names are. Then read through the scene, and see if you can tell which character is speaking just by the way they talk. You may have to do some mental gymnastics and separate what you know about the scene, if you know from the plot who is speaking you have to discard that knowledge, and just judge based on the quality of their speech.

Look out for the things we;ve covered so far:
Choice of words
Sentence length
Speech rhythm

And as well, see if they do any of those ordinary speech 
Interruptions
False starts
Self corrections
Grammar
Non-sequiturs

This is a quick exercise so just take two minutes. Cover the characters names, read through the scene, and see if you can tell who’s talking.

Exercise

So you’ve just had an experience of reading over your writing with an editor’s eye. The ability to self-edit is a great skill to have as a writer. I find this is a really useful exercise to do when redrafting a play, just going through, page by page to see if the characters are speaking in ways that are identifiably themselves.

I think there’s something interesting when you separate dialogue from its meaning in the plot, you can get an impression of a scene just from the shape of the dialogue on the page. Are there lots of short lines one after the other? This is a scene with a lot of energy and urgency. Are there longer paragraphs broken up by short one liners? Perhaps, the scene is an interrogation, or an interview. This kind of abstract look at your writing can reveal interesting things!

So, to lead up to an exercise to finish up with. Conversation.

We all engage in conversations. And will have a sense of when a conversation is going well, or going badly. As it happens a philosopher named Paul Grice came up with some rules for what makes “good conversation.” There are four rules, with some subheadings, and they are as follows.

Quantity, Quality, Relevance, and Manner. I’ll describe each, along with some of their subheadings.

Quantity
Give enough information
Don’t give more information than necessary

Quality
Don’t say something you know isn’t true
Don’t say something that you have no evidence for

Relevance
Say things that are related to the current topic

Manner/Style
Avoid obscure/ overly complicated words
Be clear
Be brief
Be orderly i.e. tell an anecdote in the sequence it happened
Now, while these may be good rules for healthy, balanced, conflict-free conversation. These are great for everyday life, however that’s not necessarily what we want from our characters! Theatre thrives on conflict, they don’t call it drama for nothing. It can be very dramatic to have a character who breaks one or more of these rules.

For example, someone breaking the 2nd Rule of Quantity “Don’t give more information than necessary”, might go into great detail when giving a statement about a bank robbery, without ever getting to the point: “Well, I was standing in line at the bank, and I noticed that they had an employee of the month picture up for June, July, and September, only it was the same person in each picture, and I remember wondering at the time, what happened in August?”

An example of a great character who breaks a whole litany of these rules is Uncle Colm in Derry Girls. I’ve included a clip, you can pause this video and watch the clip, try and note down the conversational rules he’s breaking.

 https://youtu.be/dY-H6W3kBNE?t=79

Great! So which rules did he break? The ones that I noticed were: he gives more information than necessary, says things unrelated to the current topic, is anything but brief, and often tells longwinding stories in a circuitous fashion.

If you noticed some that I missed, feel free to email to alert us.

So a final exercise:

Exercise: Re-write your weather scene so that one character breaks one of the conversation rules. How does this change the dynamic of the scene?

How does it change how they speak? How does it change what happens in the scene?

There’s still the blueprint: one person trying to tell the other person something they don’t want to hear. 

But the twist can open up really exciting avenues for the scene. If you find it is going in a new direction that is interesting, funny, dramatic, go with it.

So that’s the exercise to work on today and send in to us.

Now to wrap up:

Wrapping Up
Dialogue is part of what makes plays special, and the back and forth between characters can be really enjoyable to write.
The key to writing good dialogue is observing people talking. 
I’ve one piece of advice: Don’t listen to music on the bus*. Pay attention to how people are speaking, and listen like a thief!**

*Or train, or walking through town
** Also keep a notebook with you, or use the notes on your phone, to write down any gems you overhear
