     <h2><em>Live Giallo! Now!!</em></h2>
     <img src="/images/LGN Poster.jpg" alt="Live Giallo! Now!! Poster" style="float: left;height: 600px; width: 400px;">
     <p>Joe knows there's something they're not telling us.
      He believes shampoo companies are participating in a campaign of mass brainwashing
      and he's convinced vending machines are programmed to short-change him, specifically him.
      Len's a bouncer. He got the nod for tonight off a fella he used to work with.
      Len doesn't know what he's gotten himself into.

      Live Giallo! Now!! is a new play by Jim Connell-Moylan.
      It’s a story of conspiracy theories and necessary fictions, urban legends and lost opportunities.
      Over the course of one evening, the play explores cynicism, naiveté,
      and how open to manipulation the most steadfastly skeptical can become.
      <em>Live Giallo! Now!!</em> is a tragedy in real-time.</p>

     <h2><em>TRANSITION YEAR</em></h2>
     <img src="/images/TY Flyer.jpg" alt="TY Poster" style="float: left;height: 600px; width: 400px;">
     <p>At the apex of adolescence, peak hormonal freakout,
      secondary school students across Ireland are given the option
      to take a year off from the exam cycle and focus instead on personal growth.
      This is clearly an insane idea. And, yet.

      Mixing spoken-word, storytelling and song, this performance will bring you
      hurtling back to your awkward years.
      Heartache + heartbreak.
      Nights out + trips abroad.
      Vandalism, violence + possibly the first
      (hopefully the last) Fine Gael folk song penned to date.

      Equal parts garage rock and bedroom pop confessional,
      <em>TRANSITION YEAR</em> is a contradictory love-letter to being 16.</p>

     <h2><em>The Bull: Death of a Ladiez Man</em></h2>
     <img src="/images/Bull Poster.jpg" alt="The Bull Poster" style="float: left;height: 600px; width: 400px;">
     <p> A husband and wife looking for fun, friendship and maybe more.
      A stranger walks into their back garden and stays for dinner.
      Things take a turn for the worse.

      <em>The Bull: Death of a Ladiez Man</em> is a play about information,
      deception, and the family unit.</p>
